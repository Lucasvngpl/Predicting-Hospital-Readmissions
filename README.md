Continuing my AI ML journey, I followed a project that uses machine learning to predict hospital readmissions. I applied my knowledge of how to clean and process data, and some knowledge I had on logistical regression. 

What I learned from the project was how to obtain and interpret the results of different machine-learning models and compare model performance. Working with this kind of data, relationships tend to be non-linear so linear regression was fairly inaccurate, and ultimately decision trees won out. 

The decision tree model indicates the highest importance of time spent in the hospital, number of total patients, and discharge to another hospital in predicting if a patient will be readmitted.

This project has implications for identifying readmission factors enables targeted interventions, reducing post-discharge complications and enhancing patient outcomes.
